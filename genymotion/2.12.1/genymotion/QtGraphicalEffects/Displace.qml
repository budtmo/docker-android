        This property defines the source item for the pixels that are going to
        be displaced according to the data from
        \l{Displace::displacementSource}{displacementSource}.

        \note It is not supported to let the effect include itself, for
        instance by setting source to the effect's parent.
    */
    property variant source

    /*!
        This property defines the item that is going to be used as the
        displacement map. The displacementSource item gets rendered into the
        intermediate pixel buffer. The red and green component values from the
        result determine the displacement of the pixels from the source item.

        The format for the displacement map is similar to the tangent space
        normal maps, which can be created with most 3D-modeling tools. Many
        image processing tools include the support for generating normal maps.
        Alternatively, the displacement map for this effect can also be a QML
        element which is colored appropriately. Like any QML element, it can be
        animated. It is recommended that the size of the diplacement map matches
        the size of the \l{Displace::source}{source}.

        The displace data is interpreted in the RGBA format. For every pixel:
        the red channel stores the x-axis displacement, and the green channel
        stores the y-axis displacement. Blue and alpha channels are ignored for
        this effect.

        Assuming that red channel value 1.0 is fully red (0.0 having no red at
        all), this effect considers pixel component value 0.5 to cause no
        displacement at all. Values above 0.5 shift pixels to the left, values
        below 0.5 do the shift to the right. In a similar way, green channel
        values above 0.5 displace the pixels upwards, and values below 0.5 shift
        the pixels downwards. The actual amount of displacement in pixels
        depends on the \l displacement property.

    */
    property variant displacementSource

    /*!
        This property defines the scale for the displacement. The bigger scale,
        the bigger the displacement of the pixels. The value set to 0.0 causes
        no displacement.

        The value ranges from -1.0 (inverted maximum shift, according to
        displacementSource) to 1.0 (maximum shift, according to
        displacementSource). By default, the property is set to \c 0.0 (no
        displacement).

    property real displacement: 0.0

    /*!
        This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
        improve the rendering performance.

        Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in
        the cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an
        extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

        It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
        properties are animated.

        By default, the property is set to \c false.
